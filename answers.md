* What would it mean to build a robot?
* What would it mean to understand french?
* What makes you think that I like you?
* What makes you think that I confuse you?


A example of when this structure wouldn't work well, is with a sentence asking for reason. The code/bot doesn't have enough information to respond to the reasoning with more reason. The response given doesn't make sense.

*Ex:* Why does the Earth rotate around the sun?
* Response: You don't say.

You could improve it by making the bot more aware. 

You could improve it by make the bot more "aware." However, that would make the code more complicated. It need to look for the 'why' keyword, so it can respond accordingly with different responses based on the type of question.
